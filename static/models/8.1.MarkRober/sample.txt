Today I'm going to show you the water
and then the way to the best thinking we think
about the concept of the description or
getting the science the second and then
you can see the bigger difference is
the same step and then you can see the
things to the back of the board to
the the themeres of the ten the
their hands they are a little bit more
you're like I don't know that I'm gonna
throw the them and the trick of the
thing is the same thing you can see
there's a little bit more for the

Today I'm going to show you the water
the works in the description or go to the topical motely there. It was something to test in the longer water and it could be some crastes from the four times the content with the party like this
she's and then the size of the car
is and then you get the right started
they think they was a little bit more for a frew

Today I'm going to show you the water is the four hands the person in the back of the board it's the best month to see if you can see the bent then the competition
that containst use the air molecules on the ten where you have the reason why is the best strategy as that so we got a lot of times,
And then the final inclumbed would be it comes down to the bottom
So the content instead of the rail ridicut and then it will be there in the video description or go to the top out of the extra situations
to the flame water can take and then

Today I'm going to show you how that we can be any about of the scientific method, is head it to the strong to be a bunch of test but if they was any basically to me and then I will take to make the treat of the wheels are the ten is to start to be a single bottom of the part is the best three is a little bit because it's like the course the meas is the same thing you can do the same thing is the board is the best
the streem is with the first and we get to the bottom one the functional distance the way the best tricky is the bottle s

Today I'm going to show you the water
and then they look like the turn the
clues to the first thing that's a cool
top they can see if you can create a video
description to measure the air in the
concentration of starts and the balloon for
the front and as you can see the link in
the video description guy because it
it's also why they was coming from the
world and then at the end of the caller
and then they would take a video of the
competition that's the same thing that is

this is why they see t

Today I'm going to show you how the first thing I show you the back
will go the top of the description
and then you can see the back of the
course it's like what's all the true year
down the track of the world and then you
like the link in the video description to get
the extra force five miles and then I test
this support to the less than the week
and then the best world and then you
can see the different chances of the
head they have the same thing because the
course is there's a little bit more like
the the first thing that we can

Today I'm going to show you the water because of the air molecules in the lock of the rock skipping
your head if you think the answer is the
best week or you could like the link it
it's it's a little bit more interesting is
it weren't so if you want to start
to the right stuff to do the links is
the description or go to the trick of the
video description I will show you the same
thing because we talked about the
camera which is the energy from the result

Today I'm going to show you this with a simple from the deverig of the link in the description, but they went they to a back to the package is to see if they will be track to the protent in the board that is the back of the best starts
We've seen the back of the bottom with the process from the people who are the pressure is the length of the rear for the rest of the links is the the and that makes it there is the same time that means that they would be two dersons that the collors of the strategy, to the corronation.

Today I'm going to show you the topic of the car for the first time but it wasn't as a big car that means the more than official pool and then I think you can come in the pool and then you have the are and then the car that that would be a big card to control the point then we have the rest of the world's poorest the lives that are at the end of the because it's like the way they did the track
and then the more than the heavier the rungine doesn't work in the back to the bottom of the rotation
But the more is that we can make the lit

or even the experiment and then the final steps is up they take and then because they did the seet the blocks out of the board, they can see the reason they should start to stay the anything else so the bottom the course is here is the best way that is the sky board or the bottom of the packet they could do the problem with the way the world is to really call the final thing to make it and then they would then

Today I'm going to show you this back of the world's finest like that.
It was the solating moth nature for the force of the rest of the scientific method, is head so the bottom
It receing the same thing that it should be super to find the the direct day of the spring and then any of the concept of the video was a little bit
more pressure and then they do the
they're like I have the same thing and
I've got this balloon I'm gonna stray
there in the competition seems to get

Today I'm going to show you the side of the pound of the bottle and then we can see the right strategy
and then the party to the bottom of the bottle is the ten the pressure so
that's the energy of the answer is the
liquid of the answer would be there's
a cool part you want to teach it there
you guys have the air so the concent of the
thing you think about the more you're
gonna wit the trick is the middle of the
competitions that you can see if there
it's a true here it's like I'm gonna show
you the two things that you can see

Today I'm going to show you the car on the best way to this point it's the best
the basic content the best because the
theere are the tending of the tame a
little bit more dense than the scale
and you can see the side of the course of
the test the things you can see there
so there's like the ten is a string to
see how much friction so they would take
a challenge is the same thing that's
like with the results and then you
did that the world and then you look at
the the this is the stream in the way
they do the test with the way they

the best we started with the bottle is the world's cool stuff we went the top of the track and then when they should start to stip and then the track the link in the description, to get the end of the the wheels are the strategy, and then the balloons the results. I was like the rest and then the top it off the track in the friction of the reason there are the bottom of the skillshere of the ten than in the world the heavie in my house and there's the book of the case it was fult like the care in the botto

I concerted the first thing I was a big in the
competition the card that they have the same things all right and for
the strategy to the pressure that's like
a lot of times that's what they have the
talk of the way to the the things you
can see the back I might have seen a science
to see what is they show you have this
is the science class then also this
is why the last steep in the description
to do that we made this is the best

I think they can kind of the best thingy you
can easily really want to test this is
better than I could then I take the
bails on the science and then we started
with the the the the air in the middle
engine well that is a scale and then the
particles to the top of the extermed
out the brottom the tiped of the stars will
tell you we want to show the same thing
that spends to the force of the string
that's the treat of the air molecules
now there's no way to the ten is that

the same steep and then you get the test
on the the three your pile of a person while
we were trying to take your hands to be super more
you're like hey they're like I should you
can see you so that's the energy of
the first is that is the the things
they really figured in the house why do
you think they're like I should me and now

at the end you should also mention that the record the first time is the best person in the wall, you want to test thinking about what I wanted
to the colors that they work to the work
I was starting to survive and so the

things are like the last thing we're

So the build is the thing in the room they have to be in the way to the plant you got to the bottom of the bottle to the car then they can see the car is the track of the way
they do the trick is the trick of the wallet were in the root possible and that is the bottle is that they can see his thing area so if you want to say thank you the wavelength and then you like this car and then they think they wasn't all the car the balloon to get the rotation is the other six months we have a little

so it's a statting you can see the car
they would be super fart you can see
there's so much as faster than what
